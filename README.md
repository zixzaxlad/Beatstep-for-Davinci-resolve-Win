## Q&A

Q: Can I stick with a midi controller without buying a panel?

A: Technically yes but not recommended. It was meant to be an alternative to the Mini panel, I would say it works better with a Micro panel. Part of the reason we use panel is for muscle memory, MIDI controller is just a temporary alternative solution. If you are gonna pursue color grading as a career, you would eventually buy a real panel.

Q: Will there be a 4K or 1080p version?

A: 4K maybe, I don't have a 1080p screen right now, but there will be an instruction about change resolution.

Q: Will there be a paid version or consultant?

A: No, this whole project is based on other people's job, and I'm really not good at coding, If you have a problem or need some new feature, feel free to post in the Issues tab. I may not resolve every issue since it's just a part time project.

Q: How can I contribute to this project?

A: Test it, come up with a better structure, add function by yourself, everything is welcomed.
